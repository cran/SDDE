\title{compares two given networks (original and augmented, presented as undirected graphs) using a path analysis}
\description{This function is equivalent to the \code{\link{complete_network}} function, but it uses a fixed number of pathways to be investigated, which are divided in groups to allow restarting or better dispatching of tasks in a cluster environment.}

\arguments{
  \item{g1}{the original network X}
  \item{g2}{the augmented network Y with additional nodes (all the original nodes from X must be present in the augmented network Y)}
  \item{taxnames}{the taxon name of the nodes added to the original graph (default: we select all nodes that are not in g1)}
  \item{resultfile}{filename to which results are saved after each group (default='result.txt')}
  \item{size}{the number of paths to investigate at each iteration of the algorithm (default=1000)}
  \item{start}{the starting group of path lengths to investigate (default=1)}
  \item{end}{the ending group of path lengths to investigate (default=0 \emph{i.e.} run until the end)}
  \item{maxnode}{the maximum number of augmented nodes in network Y to take into account (default=0, no maximum number of augmented nodes to take into account)} 	  
  \item{maxtime}{the maximum search time per pathway (default=3600 seconds)} 	
  \item{maxdistance}{the maximum search distance to the added nodes in network Y (default=0, no maximum distance for augmented nodes to take into account)} 	
  \item{verbose}{flag to save into a file additionnal informations regarding the obtained paths (default=FALSE, the file name should be indicated)}
  \item{file}{filename to save the additionnal informations}  
  \item{maxcores}{maximum number of cores to use (default=1, use 0 to use half of the total cores available )}

\value{This function returns the number of paths of each category : \emph{Shortcuts}, \emph{Detours}, \emph{Dead ends}, \emph{Equal} paths and disconnected nodes.\cr If some of the augmented nodes are not visited because of the limits defined by \code{maxnode}, \code{maxtime} or \code{maxdistance}, a path can also be classified as 'Detour or Dead End'. \cr
